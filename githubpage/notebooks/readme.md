This will create a file called iris_plot.html in the current directory.

Commit the iris_plot.html file to a GitHub repository. Make sure the file is in the root directory of the repository.

To render the plot on a GitHub page, navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on the Settings tab.

Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and select master branch / folder as the source.

Click Save and wait for GitHub to build the page. Once the page is built, you should be able to view the plot by navigating to https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/iris_plot.html, where <username> is your GitHub username and <repository-name> is the name of your repository.

And that's it! You should now have a simple scatter plot rendered on a GitHub page.
