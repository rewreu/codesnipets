# To find the graphs in a list of NetworkX graphs that contain more than 2 nodes, you can use the concurrent.futures module in Python to parallelize the computation. Here's an example of how to do this:
import networkx as nx
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

# Function to check if a graph has more than 2 nodes
def has_more_than_two_nodes(graph):
    return len(graph.nodes) > 2

# Example list of NetworkX graphs
graph_list = [nx.complete_graph(n) for n in range(1, 6)]

# Use a process pool to parallelize the computation
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(has_more_than_two_nodes, graph_list))

# Filter the graphs that have more than 2 nodes
graphs_with_more_than_two_nodes = [graph for graph, result in zip(graph_list, results) if result]

# Now you have the filtered list of graphs
print(f"Number of graphs with more than 2 nodes: {len(graphs_with_more_than_two_nodes)}")
